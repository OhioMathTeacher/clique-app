- Filter by **subject** (Science, Math, Social Studies, Language Arts, Mixed, Just for Fun) and **grade band** (7–8, 9–10, 11–12)
- **Build** your own puzzle in the browser — no account, no login
- **Generate** puzzles with AI. Bring your own key for Groq (free), OpenAI, Gemini, or Claude. Keys are stored only in the browser and never uploaded

## Adding puzzles to the library

Drop a `<slug>.json` file into `puzzles/` and push to `main`. The Play list auto-discovers new puzzles via the GitHub API — no index file to maintain. Schema:

```json
{
  "title": "...",
  "author": "...",
  "language": "en",
  "subject": "Science",
  "grade": "9-10",
  "topic": "biology",
  "groups": [
    { "category": "...", "difficulty": "yellow", "words": ["A","B","C","D"] },
    { "category": "...", "difficulty": "green",  "words": ["A","B","C","D"] },
    { "category": "...", "difficulty": "blue",   "words": ["A","B","C","D"] },
    { "category": "...", "difficulty": "purple", "words": ["A","B","C","D"] }
  ]
}
```

The `topic` field picks the icon. See `assets/icons/topics/` for the full list — algebra, biology, chemistry, drama, food, geography, history, humor, etc.

## Tech notes

- Static site. No backend, no build step. Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Hosted on GitHub Pages from `main`. Pushing redeploys in about 30 seconds.
- AI requests go directly from the browser to your chosen provider over HTTPS.
- Local development:

  ```bash
  python3 -m http.server 8000
  ```

  Then open http://localhost:8000.
